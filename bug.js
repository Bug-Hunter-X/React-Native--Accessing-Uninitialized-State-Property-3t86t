This error occurs when you try to access a property of a state variable before it has been fully initialized.  This commonly happens when you're using asynchronous operations (like fetching data from an API) to update the state.  The component tries to render before the state has received its new value.  For example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('some_api')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.someProperty}</Text>  {/* Error here if data is still null */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, `this.state.data` might be `null` when the component initially renders, leading to a runtime error.
